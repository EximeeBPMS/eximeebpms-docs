Each version of EximeeBPMS is bound to a specific version of the **External Task Clients**.

  EximeeBPMS and its compatible **Java** External Task Client always share the same version.

<table class="table table-striped">
  <tr>
    <th>EximeeBPMS version</th>
    <th>NodeJS client</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.0.0</td>
    <td>3.1.x</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Only these default combinations are recommended (and supported) by EximeeBPMS. Nevertheless, each version of the External
Task Clients can be combined with newer patch versions of the EximeeBPMS Workflow Engine.
