# Diagnostics

{{< img src="../img/admin-diagnostics.png" title="Diagnostics" >}}

The **Diagnostics** menu allows you to view and copy diagnostics data about your environment or distribution of EximeeBPMS. The main purpose of the **Diagnostics** menu is to increase transparency by giving you easy access to important system diagnostics information. In the event of an issue, this should also improve problem diagnosis by enabling you to quickly understand and share the EximeeBPMS environment you are running.

# Execution Metrics

{{< img src="../img/admin-execution-metrics.png" title="Execution Metrics" >}}

The Execution Metrics menu in Admin displays an approximate number of *Flow Nodes Instances (FNI)*,
*Executed Decision Elements (EDE)*, *Process Instances (PI)* and *Decision
Instances (DI)* processed by the engine and *Task Users (TU)* that were assigned to a
user task by the selected contract start date.

The page displays the rolling last 12 months metrics in a chart and table.
Legacy metrics (FNI, EDE) are hidden by default, but can be displayed by selecting the **Display legacy metrics** checkbox.
Underneath, it displays all the available annual usage metrics.

Annual metrics together with the diagnostics data can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on
the <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-copy"></i></button> button.
The copied format consists of two parts as seen below in the example.
<<<<<<< HEAD
The second part contains the diagnostics data which provides useful information that helps EximeeBPMS to improve support but customers can opt out of sharing it.
